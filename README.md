## Source Code

All `Packages` are committed with `.unitypackage`, and the `.unitypackage` will provide all the **source code** including **sample code**.

why `.unitypackage` ? 

Because the `Packages` are part of the `MojoUnity` framework, so they share some `basic code`, but these codes are not function cohesive and cannot be a `Package`, if want to keep the `code` easy to use and not repeat, a better way is to provide `.unitypackage`.

Further, the `Packages` hava a unified directory structure, so the `share code` can be unique when multiple `Packages` are imported into Unity.
